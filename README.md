# aromatherapy

My project is to create a virtual store to purchase candles.  The candles are a real product - Aromascape candles - that I've purchased from Kroger.  They are not my  product line, and this is not a real store that I am intending to create. This is just a webpage to display part of their candle selection, and to simulate part of a typical online purchase process. Potential customers can peruse the candles, and see the prices of the candles. They can also read a little about the history of candles on the Index page. It will also have,a working contact us page. with some textboxes to input info, with the goal of using some of the input, name or email, to let the customer know that their question, comment, or suggestion is under review.


The webpage should show a navigation menu and layout that expands and collapses for the different viewing devices.

The webpage will use a hamburger menu when the screen is mobile device sized.

The webpage will use Flexbox to organize content areas based on different viewing devices.

Javascript but I am not sure how just yet.
