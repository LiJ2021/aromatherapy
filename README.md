# aromatherapy

My project is to create a virtual store to purchase candles.  The candles are a real product - Aromascape candles - that I've purchased from Kroger.  They are not my  product line, and this is not a real store that I am intending to create. This is just a webpage to display part of their candle selection, and to simulate part of a typical online purchase process. Potential customers can peruse the candles, and see the prices of the candles. They can also read a little about my store on the About Us page, but that will probably be lorem ipsum. It will also have, i hope, a working contact us page. with some textboxes to input info.


The webpage should show a navigation menu and layout that expands and collapses for the different viewing devices.

The webpage will use Flexbox to organize content areas based on different viewing devices.

Javascript but I am not sure how just yet.
