# aromatherapy

My project is to create a virtual store to peruse candles.  The candles are a real product - Aromascape candles - that I've purchased from Kroger.  They are not my  product line, and this is not a real store that I am intending to create. This is just a webpage to display part of their candle selection, and to simulate part of a typical online process. Potential customers can peruse the candles, and see the prices of the candles. They can also read a little about the history of candles on the Index page. It will also have a working contact us page with some textboxes to input info, with the goal of using some of the input, name and/or email, to let the customer know that their question, comment, or suggestion is under review.


The webpage should show a navigation menu and layout that expands and collapses for the different viewing devices.

The webpage uses a hamburger menu when the screen is mobile device sized.

The webpage will use Flexbox and CSS to organize content areas based on different viewing devices.

My webpage uses media queries to implement the different viewing options, specifically for the candle_details webpage - going from a column on a mobile device, to two columns on a Ipad-sized device, to three rows on a larger screen. 

I am trying to use JavaScript on my Contact Us & Thank You pages to use the 'first name' and 'email' of the information that has been entered on the Contact Us page to display it on the Thank You! page in the places where I have FIRSTNAME and EMAIL.  I am using document.write as a way to call the info once the Contact Us form has been submitted.
